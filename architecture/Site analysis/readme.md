## Site analysis

The main questions for us were what ammount of solar energy we can collect on the surfases of our shell and what amount of rainwater we can have in each month from the roof to use in ablution blok.

Firstly, we've make a scan of the site using iPad with lidar for the ground and relief scan and photos from drone to have trees with leaves in the simulation. Photogrammetry was a technique for making models from photos. 

For the simulatons we've use weather data for our region and also statistics from geo-meteo-centre. Here is the links for our data sourses ().
Simulations were made in Rihnoceros 3d program using Ladybug tools () and Grasshopper plugin.

Here is some of simulation results. The software is powerfull enough to simulate also heating systems and work of the solar panels.

After this analysis we've choose the orientation of the shell and desided not to make transpsrent roof and wall from the north side.
