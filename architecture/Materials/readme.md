The main materials we've use is wood (wooden beams and planks and also plywood), corrugated polycarbonate (for the transparent parts of the shell) and galvanized corrugated metal sheets (roof and wall from north). Additional materials are natural insolation from hemp, ceramic thermal mass and others.
