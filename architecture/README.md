# Architecture of ablution block

## A Section to collect and discuss solution from architects perspective

We came to idea that there are two independent parts of the ablution block: the CORE and the SHELL. In this case the core can be unified and become mostly technological solution (focused on systems, their efficiency and inegration). The shell than can be different in different cases and be more context oriented. Architecture of the shell of the first prototype corresponds to the context of Creative Rural Hub. Site analysis that we have atart from has influence on final design. Still this shell can be used in many similar cases as well.
