### Solar collector. 
We place the collector between the shells. This makes it possible to increase its productivity in case of severe frosts. It is possible to increase the number of collectors up to 6 pieces.

### Boiler of indirect heating. 
This version of the boiler makes it possible to heat water due to solar energy from the collector and reduce the amount of electricity consumption

### Three-way faucets. 
They help to manage the accumulation and use of thermal energy more rationally. After the boiler is heated by solar energy, the three-way tap redirects the surplus to the heat accumulator. During the operation of the heat pump, it can heat one tank with water up to 30 degrees. This water enters the boiler and reduces electricity consumption for additional heating by the boiler. The supply to the boiler can also be carried out from the heat accumulator if it is more rational for the system. Redirection of water flows is also carried out through three-way taps.

### Heat accumulator. 
Collects excess heat in the system and releases it when necessary.

### Heat pump (internal and external units). 
The main climate control system with high efficiency and the possibility of heating water in the system up to 30 degrees.

### Self-cleaning filter 
Unpretentious in operation and makes it possible to simplify the gray water disposal system

### Gray water tanks.
Installed in the floor. Before disposal, gray water accumulates in the room and works as an additional thermal mass. During its stay in the room, it gives off heat and after that it is safely disposed of in the drainage system.

### Dry toilet.
The use of such a system excludes the presence of "black water" and thereby simplifies the water management system as a whole. There is a composter under the toilet behind the room envelope. Dry toilet waste is discharged into a large, removable tank. Emptying the dry toilet filling into the composter is carried out after filling. The automation of this system is at the stage of development. In case of successful implementation, the comfort during operation of such a system will be at the level of ordinary water systems.

### Clean water tanks. 
(2 pcs) One tank with heat pump heat pump.

### Prefilter and settling tank.
Filter for primary purification of gray water from large debris (hair, food particles, etc.)
The second stage of gray water treatment is through a settling tank before entering the gray water tanks. It is important to carry out a good preliminary treatment of gray water, since the pipes in the system are of a rather small diameter and can easily become clogged with large particles.
