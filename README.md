# Open Source off grid ablution block

![alt text](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/blob/main/work%20in%20progress.jpeg?raw=true)

## Definition
Ablution block is a simple structure with toilets, showers, and wash basins, for communal use, as at a camping ground, caravan park , etc. It can also include facilities for cooking food, washing cloth and common sitting area. 

## Background 
We have been experimenting with various systems for sustainable  lifestyle, including composting, grey water management, solar power, sustainable water management and food growing because there is real need in our space (Creative Rural Hub) for that, since there is no central water or canalisation and electric capacity are limited to old village line capacity. A lot of these experiements created background for development of the off grid movable ablution block, that could provide large number of people with access to basic facilities (washing, cooking, wc). All these activities has became super relevant and urgent due to ongoing war in Ukraine, in order to cope with large number of people moved to safer territories, and to help rebuild destroyed cities and villiges. Work on the implementation of the first prototype continued in partnership with the Ostriv Platform.


## Approach 
We would like to use open source model for developing solutions for ablution block in these main categories  

* [Architecture](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/architecture) (general concept, shape, materials, construction methods, user experience)
* [Integrated engineering systems](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/integrated%20system) (how all systems can be combined)
* [Water](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/water) (drinking water collection/filtration, waste water management)
* [Power](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/power%20station) (electricity source)
* [Composting](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/composting) (composter for all organic waste)
* [Heating](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/heating-cooling) / cooling (heat system for all purposes)
* [Brains](https://github.com/Lifesystems-Laboratory/ablution-block/tree/main/brains) (smart systems to control everything and collect usage data)

There is an overlap in all this categories and there could be common modules, so these categories are mainly for easier collaboration and grouping problems by expertise.

First prototype was developed in cooperation of Creative Rural Hub and Ostriv Platform within the Lifesystems Laboratory with the support of Tolocar. Tolocar is a program implemented in cooperation with MitOst and supported by the German government through Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.
